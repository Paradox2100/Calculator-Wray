For Special Features I've implemented a more graphing style calculator that can calculate a whole line,
and has the abiltiy to backspace and enter many different buttons in a row.

Also, I've used exception handlers to hopefully make sure the user doesn't just mess something up and cause
the app to suddenly close.

Please don't fail me. =(
